3Why Data Structures & Algorithms?
Data structures + algorithms = program
4What is data?
•Data vs Information
•In some definition, data  mean 
raw data where information  
mean data ready to be used
•We process  data to make it 
useful 
5•Data is facts
•There are abundant data in the 
world, we can only make use some  
of them
•With computer, have capability to 
make use more and more of them.
•Basic Operations – CRUD
•Create
•Retrieve
•Update
•DeleteWhat is Algorithms?
•Can be viewed as “ways to achieve a certain goal”.
•Processing data is one of them.
•An algorithm is a recipe which leads to the required output.
•Recent development: data can be mined, algorithms can be learnt.
What is computer?
•Information processing machine
•Help us solving problem by processing information faster 
6What to learn in DSA class?
•Characteristics of good data 
structures / algorithms and tool 
for analyzing them. 
•Basic data structures
•Array, Linked List
•Concept of Abstract Data Type 
(ADT) and some simple ADT
•Stack, Queue, Heap, Tree , Graph 
•A mathematical model of data 
types. 
•We only care about what it can 
do and sometimes its efficiency, 
but not how it implement.
7•Abstraction (Daily life 
perception)
•More example → speaker
What to learn in DSA class? (cont.)
8•Fundamental algorithms
•Sorting and searching
•Some advance data structures and algorithms
•Binary Search Tree (BST), AVL Tree, Splay Tree
•Minimal Spanning Tree, Shortest Path
•HashingImagine if you have only one book.
•You don’t need any structure or algorithm 
for your data (book)
9How about seven books
•Well, still manageable.
10Make it a hundred
•Now, I think  we need some order!
•We need to structure them somehow.
•We also need a way (an algorithm)
to deal with them.
11Structured them
•Alphabetical order seems to be a smart choice
•Binary search can be used to find a book quickly
•Data structure → ordered array
•Algorithm → binary search
•What other algorithms are involved?
12Let keep going..
•Is alphabetical order still enough?
•Any good idea?
13Let structure them!
•Dewey Decimal Classification – DDC 
•a.k.a. Library System
•Using hierarchy classification
•For example
500 Natural sciences and mathematics
    510 Mathematics
        516 Geometry
            516.3 Analytic geometries
                516.37 Metric differential geometries
                    516.375 Finsler  geometry
** Cuypers  Library, Amsterdam, Netherlands
14Beyond Data Structures & Algorithms
•Where to physically store the books?
•How to connect an alphabetical order to the DDC?
•How to add/take out/return/remove books?
•What is the function of librarian, comparing to computer system?
15Summarize
•Data Structures + Algorithms = 
Program
•There are abundant data in the 
world
•Some of them are useful to us.
•We have capability to make use 
more and more of them.
•We create, retrieve, update, and 
delete useful data. 
•Data can be processed to make it 
even more useful.•Algorithms can be thought as 
ways to process data
•Computer makes DSA necessary
•although DSA are useful even 
before the age of computer
•In Data Structures and Algorithm 
class, we will learn
•Some basic data structures and 
algorithms
•How to recognize good ones
•Also, some advanced ones

•Collection of classes
•One of them have a designated main method.
•Can be packed into JAVA archive (.jar) and run as an executable (.exe) in 
JAVA ready machine
•Create by SUN Microsystem
•Slogan from 1995: Write (and compile) once, run anywhere
•Bought by Oracle in 2010, 
•Thus, Oracle’s implementation (licensed) is the de facto standard.
•OpenJDK is one of the notable free implementation.

39Static vs. Dynamic
40•It's important to understand the distinction between static and 
dynamic behaviors in classes.
•You can invoke a class static  attribute or method  directly by naming the 
class .
•Whereas, in a (dynamic) non-static  class: you need to create an instance  
with the new operator.
•(Again) A class is just a packaging of methods and data.
•Static: There is only ONE copy of the data, and only ONE copy of the 
methods in memory.
•You can create any number of instances of a dynamic class.
•each instance  has its own copy of variables
•It helps to also think: each instance has its own copy of methods

41public class A {
  static int val_a1 = 1;
  static void method_a1(int x) {
      print("From method_a1() " + val_a1 );
      println(" local argument value 
                            is " + x);
  }
}
public class B {
  int val_b1;
  B(int v) { val_b1 = v;  }

45Collections Framework Hierarchy in Java

47
https://slideplayer.com/slide/9739625 / ArrayList
•Java ArrayList is the resizable -array implementation of the List 
interface. 
•The size, isEmpty , get, set, iterator , and list iterator operations 
run in constant time. The add operation runs in amortized 
constant time, that is, adding n elements requires O(n) time. All 
of the other operations run in linear time (roughly speaking). The 
constant factor is low compared to that for the LinkedList 
implementation.
48HashSet
•Java HashSet is the basic implementation the Set interface that 
is backed by a HashMap. It makes no guarantees for iteration 
order of the set and permits the null element.
•This class offers constant time performance  for basic operations 
(add, remove , contains  and size), assuming the hash function 
disperses the elements properly among the buckets. 
•We can set the initial capacity and load factor for this collection. 
The load factor is a measure of how full the hash map is allowed 
to get before its capacity is automatically increased.
49HashMap
•HashMap class is roughly equivalent to Hashtable, except that it 
is unsynchronized and permits null. This class makes no 
guarantees for the order of the map. It is implemented on the 
Map interface.
•This implementation provides constant -time performance for 
the basic operations ( get and put). 
•It provides constructors to set initial capacity and load factor for 
the collection
